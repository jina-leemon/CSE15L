**The symptom**: java throws index out of bounds error
(not in the commit message history but couldn't edit that so added it in as a comment)

**Description**:<br>
relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input:<br>

The symptom of the failure was that java threw an index out of bounds error when there was no index of "(", ")", "[", "]" when there are no brackets or paranthesis to begin with.
